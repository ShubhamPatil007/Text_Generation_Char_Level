# Text Generation using Keras LSTM
 This model has trained with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone book. Fed with sequence of characters and trained to predict next character.
 
 Model takes sequence of 30 characters and generate next character with highest probability. By iteratively feeding with sequence of characters model start to generate next characters and at the end come up with whole new sentences which is not in the book.
 
 
Generated sentences seems to be quite right with correct grammer and syntax as if the neural network has completely understood the structure of sentences. Well... network has learnt to put right character at right place but it doesn't know the meaning of the sentences and hence sometimes makes meaningless sentences.


But it is quite interesting to see how model puts characters at right place and create sentences
